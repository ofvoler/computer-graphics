Final project from Computer Graphics course at DIS - Danish Institute for Study Abroad.

This project utilizes triplanar texture mapping to texure a 3D terrain model in JavaScript. This method uses world space texture mapping to project a different texture on the sides and top of the model. I use a biome map to render two biomes onto the terrain. I also incorporate a third texture that is only implemented at a certain altitude.

Download files and open engine.html in a live server (e.g. package 'atom-live-server' on Atom) to see the finished code, or see a preview below.
